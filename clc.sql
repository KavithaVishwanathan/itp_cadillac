However, because ofit\'s uniqueness, I need advice on how to set a price and what the best route is forfinding a buyer. Should I set a price and advertise or seek out an auction house or go toEbay or contact museums? Does it make financial sense to invest in paying for restoration(fix the airbags, deal with the problems caused by it sitting unstarted for twenty years,and sew a few of the seams splits in the leather seats together) prior to selling it, orlook for an individual who relishes the chance to restore the vehicle? Plus, does havingthe original manual and the tumblers and cigarette case factor into a final price? Well,Matthew, I share the opinion of other CLC members who responded to your query. &nbsp; Ifyou are bent on selling the car, I recommend you leave it &quot;as is&quot; and find thehighest bidder.&nbsp; These cars certainly have appreciated in value over the last 10years; from your description, it sounds as though it is in good to very good condition; itis a two-owner, low-mileage car that has never left Pennsylvania, where it was delivered,initially, in 1957.&nbsp; That said, I would not recommend that anyone buy it without athorough inspection by a Eldorado Brougham expert.&nbsp; There are a few in theclub.

His family has owned the car since 1958. He said : The car was purchased in 1958by my Grandfather and has been in the family since. It was delivered at a Cadillacdealership in Lancaster, PA, and remained in PA until we moved to Illinois in 2004. It hasbeen garaged for the entire time. From what family members say and then confirmed in theinsurance papers, the price paid was $15,000. My grandfather loved the car and used itonly on special occasions and to go to church.&nbsp; Mr. Hicks chauffeured the car when myGrandmother went to Atlantic city for a number of years as a summer escape (pre-casinos).My mother once drove the car by herself for a weekend trip to New York City. It carried mymother and her new husband from their wedding reception to the Honeymoon car parkedoutside of town. It also carried my grandfather\'s widow Rhoda and family to the funeral in1965. After his death the car became the property of his wife, Rhoda . She used it onoccasion. As a child, I remember being driven to the pool in the Brougham as well as to adrive-in movie. My friend and I played with the electric windows and ran the battery downso that the car had to be jumped to get home. The rising of the car [air lift]when it started was a very memorable event. The car\'s ownership came into my hands upon mygrandmother\'s death in 1985. I did not live in the area however, and the vehicle stayed inthe garage of the same house that my mother then inherited. Mr. Hicks was the gentlemanwho would take care of the car and changed it\'s oil, gave it a great coat of wax andstarted it regularly.

This has been a rather continuousprocess which has been successful in terms of concours events in Southern California thisyear. The car has consistently won either First In Class, Best of Show and the like. Itwas First in Class at this year\'s Southern California Cadillac-LaSalle Club meet on May 2and First in Class and Most Elegant at the Muckenthaller in Orange County May 16. The carwas completely restored prior to my purchase; it was without vanities and owners manual. Ihave since located and purchased all the vanities. I have not been able to purchase acorrect owner\'s manual. We did find some problems with paint, chrome, a/c, electrics(seats, e.g.), radio not working, antenna not extending fully, service work on the engine,a turn signal short and the like. The car sat continuously with the previous owner and Isuspect that led to some of the problems. I used Alan Taylor Restorations in Escondido,California. As you probably know, Alan has consistently prepared numerous cars for PebbleBeach and is considered one of the finest restorers in the nation [yes, I am familiarwith his outfit]. Fortunately, he also has enormous experience with Cadillacs of allages, but more importantly someone on his staff intimately familiar with all aspects ofthe EB. The car is not the original colors of 148 Kenya Beige with 434 BeigeCloth/Leather. It is now Fairfax Blue with Blue Leather and Mouton carpet.

It came there from anattorney who was liquidating an estate. Now, apparently it sat in the garage of the oldercouple who owned it at for quite some time. From what I gather (and this may or&nbsp; maynot be totally accurate) one of the elderly people died and the other didn\'t drive andwhen she finally died it came into possession of the attorney who was the executor. I amguessing that it has been sitting since 1966, since the New York State inspection stickeris still on the window. As to the condition of the car, the body is absolutely perfectexcept for some peeling paint around the front grill and some very small rust spots. Thereare no dings or dents that I can find. The stainless roof is perfect. The lights andlenses appear to all be good. The doors open and shut like a new car. The two flaws that Ican see are that the drivers side wing window is broken (all of the the glass is intactwith no problems) and a piece of the cast aluminum bumper under the gas tank door isbroken (I have the piece). As far as chrome and moldings and other &quot;doodads&quot; --they all appear to be there and the front bumper is in good condition but a trip to thechrome shop wouldn\'t hurt some of the chrome parts. The upholstery is not good but it isall there. The airbags are all there - &nbsp; I have heard that they were commonlyreplaced with springs but this seems not to be the case. The car is blue [whicheffectively matches factory records - Yann]. The things that may or may not beproblematic are that the previous owner of the building removed the engine andtransmission to be rebuilt but he never got around to it. Apparently the motor ran butsmoked so he was going to have it rebuilt. The hood was therefore removed and is in goodcondition and is with the car. As far as I&nbsp; can tell everything is there and notmissing, including the dual quads. He also removed the inside door panels from both frontdoors. Again, everything was stored in the trunk and I believe everything to be there. Ibelieve that the car is very restorable as it is not missing much as far as I can tell,and from what I gather, the trouble and expense of locating parts for rare cars like theseis monumental. By the way I am located in NY State and the car is in kind of a dark cornerbut if you want to see any pictures of anything specific get hold of me.

The car was (reportedly) bid up to $52,000 but was not sold.Apparently the car did find a buyer at the next, annual Barrett-Jackson auction inScottsdale, AZ, in January 2002 [lot #377]; however, there are conflicting auction resultsshowing a selling price of either $75,000 or $81,000!

The last nineteen years has seen almost nomileage. #279 is in original condition, save for some minor practical modifications by theoriginal owner. The paint is ebony (code 110) with dark &amp; light gray leather andmoutons (trim code 1502). All the vanity &amp; personal items are included; the importantcolor coordinated ones being original.

The car is still riding on its original air system andmost accessories work. At some point, following a minor accident, the car was re-sprayedand the front seat was re-upholstered. This summer we performed minor mechanical work andcosmetic detailing, entered her in three car shows and came home with Mayor&#146;s Choicein one and Top Pick in another. More significantly, we have driven the car 824 miles withabsolutely no trouble, save the crowds she draws.

I found it beautiful; I discovered they only made a very few of them, and I startedto dream of getting one. Eight years passed and one of my friends told me there was such acar in a dealership in Budapest, Hungary. I did not believe him. Next day, another friendcalled with the same message. I still could not believe it. Two hours later, my ownbrother called and confirmed that there was this 1957 Brougham at the dealership. Now Ibecame very excited; I had to check it out. Sure enough, there it was, but I was told itwas not for sale; the owner was in the USA and would be back in a week. It turned out theowner was an old friend of mine whom I had not seen for ten years; he had moved toFlorida. A week later, he called me and came to visit me ...with the Brougham.Surprisingly, he was unaware that he had a rare car; he had got it in a trade, in Florida,because he liked its looks. The car had been in a friend\'s garage in Florida; my friendhad heard there was some problem with it, some vibrations they could not seem to fix. Theowner had already spent $50.000 on the car; he had enough of it. That\'s when my friendsuggested the trade, which the owner accepted. The Brougham came to Hungary. Anyway, myfriend did not want to sell me the car ...until two days later when he tried to stop at ared light and the brakes failed. It was a miracle that he and the car survived. He saidthe car had tried to kill him; he did not want to see it any more. He let me have it forwhat it had cost him. The brake problem was quickly fixed. The odometer showed 42000 milesat the time and the car has been repainted once. The body is in great condition: no bondo,no rust, nice straight lines. On the other hand, the interior was a mess. I was lucky tofind a Brougham shop manual in Germany; this helped me to carry out various repairs. Bythe following year, the car was ready for show. I went to thirteen shows in Europe; theBrougham earned &quot;best of show&quot; or &quot;50\'s first place&quot; every time. Thatyear I did 8000 miles: I had only three minor problems which were easily fixed. Thefollowing year I replaced the interior with the correct upholstery materials. For the lasttwo years, I have not driven the car because, in the meantime, I met Michael Rizzuto andrealized that with his help I could restore it to &quot;like new&quot; condition. I knowthis will take a long time and will require a lot of work.

The quarter ventglasses are both missing but the frames are present.Bumpers -- believe it or not but theformer owner had the front bumpers re-chromed in the mid seventies and the right rearbumper is not cracked at all but does need re-chroming -- left rear bumper is broken intwo. The rear license plate holder is good-needs plating. Front-end sheetmetal - bothfront fenders are some rust out, cancer in the lower section about 4 or 5 inches worth.Grill is missing and the hood is excellent. A piece of brightwork is missing from thelower right front fender. A strip of chrome is missing from the outside right door. DOORS- all four doors were working two weeks ago when I bought the cars but now the one reardoor will not lock in place. All outside door handles are present but inside handles seemto be missing. SHEETMETAL rear of the car - one rear skirt missing as noted, the trunk lidis very serviceable and like I said the floors are solid. The sheet metal below the trunklid was ruffed up in the 70\'s tow truck accident but the license holder is good. There issome rust out in the rear directly above the skirt area. This was a parts car for overthirty years and some parts are missing. The steering wheel, radio knobs and ash traysquickly come to mind. If you do not see a part attached to the car or on the tarp wellthen consider that part as AWOL missing. Inspections are encouraged and appointments canbe made by email or by calling 413-562-9298.

There may be also other &quot;minor&quot; originality flaws, suchas that weird, carpet-covered instrument panel!

Remember him? He\'s the millionaire with the museum andthe Ph.D. in Ft. Lauderdale who sold that bizarre, prize-winning red,restored-to-perfection &quot;1959-60&quot; Cadillac convertible with TV in the dash,claiming it to be &quot;the&quot; 1959 prototype 1960 Cadillac show car from the 1959 GMMotorama [check it out].

In the description the vendor said $100,000 had been spent on restoringthis elegant, exquisite, spectacular car; there were kudos to Harley Earl for theBrougham prototype he showed during the 1955 Motorama, as well as to his grandson,Richard, for his website in honor of his grandfather (see below); what bearing on the saleof this car? &nbsp; According to the vendor again, every Brougham was sold before ithit the Cadillac showroom; he asserted that each Brougham came also with an EvansCadillac Lighter and a Motorama key chain and key blank.; of course, this isb/s.&nbsp; The car was offered also with ALL the vanity items ...for which the vendorclaimed he had paid $25,000! They included the Evans/Cadillac hand lighter [???] init\'s original box with instructions and&nbsp; the rare...rare...rare Motorama key chainand blank key [???]. Interestingly, in early 2007 I noticed that&quot;luvdg&quot; had paid over $50 on eBay (item 290065407769) for a boxed set of silver&quot;Cross&quot; pen and pencil; he said it was &quot;for his Brougham&quot;; they wereNOT the correct model for this car!&nbsp; This was lot #7167 at Russo &amp; Steele\'sMonterey venue in 2007; according to the catalog description, the car was restored tometiculous standards [???] over the past 12 months, with $111,000 spent on this79,000 mile car&nbsp; [in a subsequent Hemmings ad, the total receipts were claimedto amount to $130,000!]. So far as I know, no sale ensued (the bidding closed at$110,000). You will note that despite the $111,000 &quot;luvdg&quot; put into restoringthe car, the dash is far from perfect, photos show non-authentic&nbsp; hood and trunklettering as well as some vanities.

Hesays : I own a 1957 Eldorado Brougham that is not yet listed in the Data Index [theCadillac Database] and I desire to put it on the market for sale. However, because ofit\'s uniqueness, I need advice on how to set a price and what the best route is forfinding a buyer. Should I set a price and advertise or seek out an auction house or go toEbay or contact museums? Does it make financial sense to invest in paying for restoration(fix the airbags, deal with the problems caused by it sitting unstarted for twenty years,and sew a few of the seams splits in the leather seats together) prior to selling it, orlook for an individual who relishes the chance to restore the vehicle? Plus, does havingthe original manual and the tumblers and cigarette case factor into a final price? Well,Matthew, I share the opinion of other CLC members who responded to your query. &nbsp; Ifyou are bent on selling the car, I recommend you leave it &quot;as is&quot; and find thehighest bidder.&nbsp; These cars certainly have appreciated in value over the last 10years; from your description, it sounds as though it is in good to very good condition; itis a two-owner, low-mileage car that has never left Pennsylvania, where it was delivered,initially, in 1957.&nbsp; That said, I would not recommend that anyone buy it without athorough inspection by a Eldorado Brougham expert.&nbsp; There are a few in theclub. BTW, factory records show that your car had the Karakul nylon carpets andnot the optional Mouton style.

Late Late Extra [6/2005] I saw it advertised by Ron, in June2005, with a $80K price tag. Check it out on this Web page.&nbsp; Even Later Extra [9/2005] :&nbsp; the car was advertised on eBay.&nbsp; Here are excerpts about the car\'s history, asprovided by the vendor :&nbsp; The car was just purchased from the second owner\'sgrandson. His family has owned the car since 1958. He said : The car was purchased in 1958by my Grandfather and has been in the family since. It was delivered at a Cadillacdealership in Lancaster, PA, and remained in PA until we moved to Illinois in 2004. It hasbeen garaged for the entire time. From what family members say and then confirmed in theinsurance papers, the price paid was $15,000. My grandfather loved the car and used itonly on special occasions and to go to church.&nbsp; Mr. Hicks chauffeured the car when myGrandmother went to Atlantic city for a number of years as a summer escape (pre-casinos).My mother once drove the car by herself for a weekend trip to New York City. It carried mymother and her new husband from their wedding reception to the Honeymoon car parkedoutside of town. It also carried my grandfather\'s widow Rhoda and family to the funeral in1965. After his death the car became the property of his wife, Rhoda . She used it onoccasion. As a child, I remember being driven to the pool in the Brougham as well as to adrive-in movie. My friend and I played with the electric windows and ran the battery downso that the car had to be jumped to get home. The rising of the car [air lift]when it started was a very memorable event. The car\'s ownership came into my hands upon mygrandmother\'s death in 1985. I did not live in the area however, and the vehicle stayed inthe garage of the same house that my mother then inherited. Mr. Hicks was the gentlemanwho would take care of the car and changed it\'s oil, gave it a great coat of wax andstarted it regularly. He did this until his death in 1998 at the age of 97.More pics of Car #91 may be seen on this web page.',NULL,NULL,NULL,'../jalbum/Eldorado_Brougham/1957/C91/index.html',3,'1957_91'),(1957,92,'Car #92','Car #92 was ownedoriginally by the CEO of Dow Chemicals; it was reported as a survivor but now isclassified as only a parts car by enthusiast/owner Paul Dehnert of Austin, TX (cars #59 and #241).',NULL,NULL,NULL,'../jalbum/Eldorado_Brougham/1957/C92/index.html',3,'1957_92'),(1957,95,'Car #95','Car #95&nbsp; waslocated in 3/2006 by enthusiast Jean-Clause Franchitti.

I have not been able to purchase acorrect owner\'s manual. We did find some problems with paint, chrome, a/c, electrics(seats, e.g.), radio not working, antenna not extending fully, service work on the engine,a turn signal short and the like.

As you probably know, Alan has consistently prepared numerous cars for PebbleBeach and is considered one of the finest restorers in the nation [yes, I am familiarwith his outfit].

It was seen offered for sale in12/2002, in New York state. Here is what the vendor had to say: The car hasbeen sitting in a building that I have owned for about ten years. It came there from anattorney who was liquidating an estate. Now, apparently it sat in the garage of the oldercouple who owned it at for quite some time. From what I gather (and this may or&nbsp; maynot be totally accurate) one of the elderly people died and the other didn\'t drive andwhen she finally died it came into possession of the attorney who was the executor. I amguessing that it has been sitting since 1966, since the New York State inspection stickeris still on the window. As to the condition of the car, the body is absolutely perfectexcept for some peeling paint around the front grill and some very small rust spots. Thereare no dings or dents that I can find. The stainless roof is perfect. The lights andlenses appear to all be good. The doors open and shut like a new car. The two flaws that Ican see are that the drivers side wing window is broken (all of the the glass is intactwith no problems) and a piece of the cast aluminum bumper under the gas tank door isbroken (I have the piece). As far as chrome and moldings and other &quot;doodads&quot; --they all appear to be there and the front bumper is in good condition but a trip to thechrome shop wouldn\'t hurt some of the chrome parts. The upholstery is not good but it isall there. The airbags are all there - &nbsp; I have heard that they were commonlyreplaced with springs but this seems not to be the case. The car is blue [whicheffectively matches factory records - Yann]. The things that may or may not beproblematic are that the previous owner of the building removed the engine andtransmission to be rebuilt but he never got around to it. Apparently the motor ran butsmoked so he was going to have it rebuilt. The hood was therefore removed and is in goodcondition and is with the car. As far as I&nbsp; can tell everything is there and notmissing, including the dual quads. He also removed the inside door panels from both frontdoors. Again, everything was stored in the trunk and I believe everything to be there. Ibelieve that the car is very restorable as it is not missing much as far as I can tell,and from what I gather, the trouble and expense of locating parts for rare cars like theseis monumental. By the way I am located in NY State and the car is in kind of a dark cornerbut if you want to see any pictures of anything specific get hold of me. Thanks, TomTaylor.&nbsp; Tom later added:&nbsp; I\'m sorry tosay but there are no vanity items in the car. I can only guess that they went missing overthe years. As for the rest of the car it is very complete as far as I can tell with nomissing trim etc. Late Extra (1/2003): The carwas sold in January, 2003, and is now relocated in Canada; it was bought by anacquaintance of Vic Brincat [Brougham #402] and now lives inOntario.

It\'s also on Eldorado Silver [aluminumalloy] Sabre Rims. No vanities. Still on air ride, but missing the compressor and abunch of other air ride parts. I have ownership to the car, but no keys, so I don\'t haveany idea what works and what doesn\'t. I had planned on making the car into a driver,putting it on springs and keeping it on the Sabre\'s. This is one that if you re-built themotor you could drive as you restore. The car is located on Ontario Canada, and I may beable to deliver it somewhere for a fee.

I feel very lucky and honored to be able to work with and list anotherEldorado Brougham. I listed and sold two 1958 examples in the fall of \'02 and I made twobuyers very happy and lucky to be able to join a very exclusive group of car owners.This car is about 95% complete and does include some great original vanity items. This carwhich is 1957 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham #263 is alive and is a very willing candidate forrestoration. She is available to be viewed in the Chicago area and comes with a nearlycomplete set of original vanities (not repros). Complete vanities have sold in the area of$8000 recently [I sure would like to have details on any effective sales of&quot;complete&quot; Brougham vanities in the last 2-3 years].&nbsp; Click here to see completepictures and details of the included Brougham vanities.

In fact, the chrome bumpers are inexceptional condition. As a whole, the stainless pieces on the car are all in very goodshape. Currently, the car is white [this is the correct, original color] and isready for a fresh coat of paint. The car was originally painted with paint code #112 whichis Chamonix white. This car is only 1 of 45 painted that color in 1957. The IDplate reads Trim #1581 which corresponds to light gray leather with white leather [andblack, Karakul nylon carpet]. Only 10 produced with that interior trim combinationin 1957. The mileage on the odometer shows 77,500 miles. The car comes with 5 originalTurbine wheels and center caps and is still riding on air in the rear (2 new diaphragms)and on springs in the front. There is some leaking of air to the rear airbags which iscommon on these cars. This car also includes the complete set of jacking equipment. Thisis an excellent candidate for restoration. I know there are guys out there looking for aproject and with only 400 \'57 Broughams ever produced, this would be a terrific car tobring back to it\'s original splendor. Also, it is not uncommon to purchase the car withthe vanities simply to acquire the vanities and then re-sell the remaining car without thevanities. Strange as that may sound, I know of at least one instance where that hashappened [details, Ron?]. The car is not drivable which means that it starts anddrives and stops but with many parts not securely attached, it is not safe to be driven onany roads until the restoration is complete.

I found it beautiful; I discovered they only made a very few of them, and I startedto dream of getting one. Eight years passed and one of my friends told me there was such acar in a dealership in Budapest, Hungary. I did not believe him. Next day, another friendcalled with the same message. I still could not believe it. Two hours later, my ownbrother called and confirmed that there was this 1957 Brougham at the dealership. Now Ibecame very excited; I had to check it out. Sure enough, there it was, but I was told itwas not for sale; the owner was in the USA and would be back in a week. It turned out theowner was an old friend of mine whom I had not seen for ten years; he had moved toFlorida. A week later, he called me and came to visit me ...with the Brougham.Surprisingly, he was unaware that he had a rare car; he had got it in a trade, in Florida,because he liked its looks. The car had been in a friend\'s garage in Florida; my friendhad heard there was some problem with it, some vibrations they could not seem to fix. Theowner had already spent $50.000 on the car; he had enough of it. That\'s when my friendsuggested the trade, which the owner accepted. The Brougham came to Hungary. Anyway, myfriend did not want to sell me the car ...until two days later when he tried to stop at ared light and the brakes failed. It was a miracle that he and the car survived. He saidthe car had tried to kill him; he did not want to see it any more. He let me have it forwhat it had cost him. The brake problem was quickly fixed. The odometer showed 42000 milesat the time and the car has been repainted once. The body is in great condition: no bondo,no rust, nice straight lines. On the other hand, the interior was a mess. I was lucky tofind a Brougham shop manual in Germany; this helped me to carry out various repairs. Bythe following year, the car was ready for show. I went to thirteen shows in Europe; theBrougham earned &quot;best of show&quot; or &quot;50\'s first place&quot; every time. Thatyear I did 8000 miles: I had only three minor problems which were easily fixed. Thefollowing year I replaced the interior with the correct upholstery materials. For the lasttwo years, I have not driven the car because, in the meantime, I met Michael Rizzuto andrealized that with his help I could restore it to &quot;like new&quot; condition. I knowthis will take a long time and will require a lot of work.

This is oneof 45 cars made painted in Chamonix white, 14 cars were ordered with this trim # .I firstsaw this car and its mate&nbsp;in 1972 and it has served honorably as a parts donor fortwo different 57 Eldo broughams that I know of. The engine and tranny and other parts weremissing when I first saw it in 1972. Body #305 still has enough good parts to help out insaving a third brougham. This car was never put up on springs and still has the rear airbags and a few other air suspension parts located in the rear. The air compressor, airholding tank and front-end air parts are long gone. The floor pan and frame are verysolid.The only rust out, cancer that I see on the floor or trunk area is very near thebattery box.The floor pan and frame are surface-rusted and there are two dents in thefloor pan but is not rusted through except near the battery box - repairable. The gas tankis also dented. The former owner tells me that this car was dropped from a tow-truck in1971 or 1972 and the driver\'s side rear bumper was broken in half. I do have both pieces.The driver\'s side rear skirt was also destroyed in this accident and this piece ismissing. The stainless roof is dent and dimple free but does have some light scratching.Glass - the front windshield and the drivers door glass are not cracked but both do haveseveral &quot;bb gun chips&quot;. I consider both these pieces as unserviceable. Both reardoor windows are chip and crack free.The front passenger door glass is stuck in the downposition and I cannot see it - but I know the frame is at least there. The quarter ventglasses are both missing but the frames are present.Bumpers -- believe it or not but theformer owner had the front bumpers re-chromed in the mid seventies and the right rearbumper is not cracked at all but does need re-chroming -- left rear bumper is broken intwo. The rear license plate holder is good-needs plating. Front-end sheetmetal - bothfront fenders are some rust out, cancer in the lower section about 4 or 5 inches worth.Grill is missing and the hood is excellent. A piece of brightwork is missing from thelower right front fender. A strip of chrome is missing from the outside right door. DOORS- all four doors were working two weeks ago when I bought the cars but now the one reardoor will not lock in place. All outside door handles are present but inside handles seemto be missing. SHEETMETAL rear of the car - one rear skirt missing as noted, the trunk lidis very serviceable and like I said the floors are solid. The sheet metal below the trunklid was ruffed up in the 70\'s tow truck accident but the license holder is good. There issome rust out in the rear directly above the skirt area. This was a parts car for overthirty years and some parts are missing. The steering wheel, radio knobs and ash traysquickly come to mind.

It was last registered in 1975 [to Richard Serino?] and had an enginerebuild started that same year. The mileage was 32,535. The engine was well preserved withall three carburettors removed as well as the accessories. They were all in the trunk withunlabeled cans of hardware. Bumpers and front end (hood and fenders) were off and strippedof paint. Most of the chrome was painted white for preservation. At that point, the bestpart of the car was the stainless steel roof. The upholstery was the beautiful - in itsday - light grey Paerisienne cloth with light gray leather. After much research I was ableto find an almost perfect match. Exterior is Chamonix white. Once purchased, the car wastransported by flatbed to my garage in Farmingdale, Long Island, 40 miles east of Astoria.It was a sad sight and I wodered how the car could be so neglected all those years. Aftermy retirement, in March 1989, more attention was given to the Brougham and it ran again inAugust 1989.

Wayne Meadlin of Fort Worth, TX, informed me on March 8, 2000 that aMaharani Maroon 1958 Brougham was currently owned by Lee Sicilio, a Fort Worth neighbor ofhis and an American Airlines pilot.&nbsp; The current owner told Mr. Meadlin that he hadfound the car in California about&nbsp; 8-10 years ago, which might indicate it is the oneformerly owned by Mr. Gimelli.&nbsp; Late extra, July 2004:Brougham owner Kent Steine is familiar with this car.&nbsp; He wrote: Whilegoing through your pages I noticed that you do indeed have the Gonstead (#485) car on the Database.

He drove the car every day, year round;&nbsp;during the&nbsp;winter of 1965 he ran into a snow plow...there was damage to theentire front clip, and frame. The Doctor was always at our house to have my dad look at,or fix this car (my father was an electrical engineer, and knew the Brougham like the backof his hand). This was during the time my dad had&nbsp;purchased numerous new parts, andended up trading with the Doctor his banged up bumper for&nbsp;my nice original and$250.00. I still have the Gonstead bumper. The car ended up being a&quot;putty-box&quot;\'; it had serious rusting problems even back in 1965. It was also inrather poor mechanical condition and had over 60,000 miles on it at that time. &nbsp;This&nbsp;car sat outside the doctor\'s chiropractic practice, unattended, untilaround&nbsp;1980.&nbsp;In 1974 I attempted to purchase the car from him, and had anothergood look at it. It was not running, and Doc Gonstead said he hadn\'t driven it in years,but wanted $2K (which was more than I felt it was worth at the time).

Mr. Houck said he firstbought the car from the Marriotts in the 70\'s and then sold it to a Cadillac dealer inFlorida as a traffic builder. When the Cadillac dealer defaulted on the payments, Mr.Houck repossessed the car. It then apparently sat for a while before Mr. Houck did someminor work on it a few years ago.

Hesays : I own a 1957 Eldorado Brougham that is not yet listed in the Data Index [theCadillac Database] and I desire to put it on the market for sale. However, because ofit\'s uniqueness, I need advice on how to set a price and what the best route is forfinding a buyer. Should I set a price and advertise or seek out an auction house or go toEbay or contact museums? Does it make financial sense to invest in paying for restoration(fix the airbags, deal with the problems caused by it sitting unstarted for twenty years,and sew a few of the seams splits in the leather seats together) prior to selling it, orlook for an individual who relishes the chance to restore the vehicle? Plus, does havingthe original manual and the tumblers and cigarette case factor into a final price? Well,Matthew, I share the opinion of other CLC members who responded to your query. &nbsp; Ifyou are bent on selling the car, I recommend you leave it &quot;as is&quot; and find thehighest bidder.&nbsp; These cars certainly have appreciated in value over the last 10years; from your description, it sounds as though it is in good to very good condition; itis a two-owner, low-mileage car that has never left Pennsylvania, where it was delivered,initially, in 1957.&nbsp; That said, I would not recommend that anyone buy it without athorough inspection by a Eldorado Brougham expert.&nbsp; There are a few in theclub.

It was delivered at a Cadillacdealership in Lancaster, PA, and remained in PA until we moved to Illinois in 2004. It hasbeen garaged for the entire time. From what family members say and then confirmed in theinsurance papers, the price paid was $15,000. My grandfather loved the car and used itonly on special occasions and to go to church.&nbsp; Mr. Hicks chauffeured the car when myGrandmother went to Atlantic city for a number of years as a summer escape (pre-casinos).My mother once drove the car by herself for a weekend trip to New York City. It carried mymother and her new husband from their wedding reception to the Honeymoon car parkedoutside of town. It also carried my grandfather\'s widow Rhoda and family to the funeral in1965. After his death the car became the property of his wife, Rhoda . She used it onoccasion. As a child, I remember being driven to the pool in the Brougham as well as to adrive-in movie. My friend and I played with the electric windows and ran the battery downso that the car had to be jumped to get home. The rising of the car [air lift]when it started was a very memorable event. The car\'s ownership came into my hands upon mygrandmother\'s death in 1985. I did not live in the area however, and the vehicle stayed inthe garage of the same house that my mother then inherited. Mr. Hicks was the gentlemanwho would take care of the car and changed it\'s oil, gave it a great coat of wax andstarted it regularly.

As far as I&nbsp; can tell everything is there and notmissing, including the dual quads. He also removed the inside door panels from both frontdoors.

The four-passenger seating was tentatively agreed upon as well as general seating dimensions. Shortly afterward the wheel base and treads were pegged and a seating buck was fabricated with seats, steering wheel, and foot controls installed in accordance with our full-size layouts. At the same time I gave approval to start immediately on a full-size clay model. In the Eldorado Brougham dream car of 1955 were combined all the styling and mechanical characteristics that had been seen in earlier Cadillac dream cars [the Orleans, in 1953, and the Park Avenue, in 1954]. Ed Glowacke, then in charge of the Cadillac studio, had the clay model ready for show to management in August 1954. The sleek, low model was approved. Work began immediately on the hand-built prototype that was to be displayed at the 1955 Motorama show just five months later. The car was painted on January 10, just nine days before the show was due to open in new York, a two-day trip away from Detroit. At 2 a.m. on January 19, just 14 hours before curtain-up, the Brougham was accidentally damaged, front and rear, when it collapsed from its transport dolly. Emergency repairs were hastily carried out. Fortunately, there were no visible traces of the mishap when, a few hours later, the public thronged around the car on its revolving stand at the show. ',NULL,NULL,NULL),(36,'36_2',2,NULL,'The 1955 Fleetwood Eldorado Brougham, concept car #XP-38 (special order #2253), was first shown in New York to a discrete audience of some 5100 people starting at 4 p.m. on January 19, 1955 (the enthusiastic public only got to see the car next day in the Grand Ballroom of the Waldorf). Cadillac\'s Merchandising department described the Motorama Brougham for 1955 in the following terms:  Completely functional in every detail, the new 1955 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham is a luxury showcar exhibiting a wide departure from conventional automobile styling.  Exterior features of this completely new car are: a wheel base of 124 inches, overall length of 209.6 inches, overall width of 77.5 inches and an overall height of 54.4 inches - or less than 4½ feet [sic].  Outside dimensions have been reduced without sacrificing comfort in any way. Easy access is gained to this four-door car, and the absence of center door pillars affords both driver and passengers virtually unobstructed vision through 360°.  Styled in the mode of jet aircraft, the Eldorado Brougham has such features as fresh air intake on top of the front fenders, air outlets in the rear doors flush with the body panel, and dual headlight assemblies - outer lamps for the city and inner lamps for highway use - automatically controlled by an Autronic Eye.  Capped by a brushed aluminum roof, the lower exterior of the car is finished in Chameleon green.  Interior features match the modern exterior in every sense. The color of the interior is also Chameleon Green with top grain leather and imported French ripple silk is used as trim. The four individual seats are tailored to give the utmost in comfort and the driver\'s seat pivots outward, making entering and leaving the car almost automatic. The instrument panel, covered with shock absorbent material, is designed for the greatest possible visibility of controls.  A storage compartment in the instrument panel and between the front seats serves the driver and front passengers.  Located in front of the storage compartment between the seats is a courtesy light that also serves as a map light.  GM\'s latest Motorama creation was given some press coverage in Car Life for May 1955, where the following description appeared:  On a more practical plane, Cadillac has also introduced the Eldorado Brougham with an overall height of 54.4 inches and without a center door pillar [\"B\" pillar]. Fenders and characteristic tail lines are complimented [complemented?] by a tinted brushed aluminum roof. Dual headlight assemblies, Cadillac says, provide the most efficient road lighting yet devised. The outer lamps are flat beam city lights and the inner lamps are highly penetrating highway lights. Both sets are controlled by an Autronic-Eye mounted at top of windshield.  Using new methods of construction, Cadillac has reduced all outside dimensions without sacrificing passenger comfort. All seats are individual and are tailored to fit the body. Wheel base is 124 inches, overall length is 209.6 inches and width is 77.5 inches. A highly iridiscent exterior color - Chameleon green - has been developed expressly for the Brougham and the interior is trimmed in matching paint, leather and imported French silk.  The press release for the Boston venue of the Motorama, starting April 23, 1955 was worded slightly differently. It carried the reference O\'Hk 5 11255.  In September 1955, long after the brilliance and splendor of GM\'s Motorama for 1955 had waned, Motor Life carried a pictorial spread on the 1955 Eldorado Brougham prototype.  Under the heading The Eldorado Brougham - A NEW CADILLAC FOR 1956, the writer suggested that the class of super-luxury cars, neglected since the 1930\'s, was on the way back. He considered the Eldorado Brougham as certain to be a style-setter in advanced features.  The features on which the writer concentrated were the following:  Twin headlights at the front end of each fender have five-inch lenses. Outer lamps are flat-beam city lights; inner lamps are for highway use. An Autronic Eye will switch from to the other as conditions on the road require.  Interior includes padded instrument panel with recessed controls, Driver\'s seat pivots outward for easy entry and exit, while centre of both front and rear seats contains storage compartment. Note absence of small ventilator windows, considered unnecessary in a car having air conditioner and heater as integral unit.  Quad exhaust is what Cadillac is calling the system that has dual pipes issuing from the rear fenders on each side of the car. This could be said to balance dual-dual headlights in front, but benefits in engine efficiency are unknown.  Magnesium wheels simulate wire wheels [?], but obviously will be easier to clean and polish. Front bumper has been a Cadillac trademark for several years. Top of Brougham, incidentally, is tinted aluminum, forecasting more widespread use of non-rusting metal in cars to come [no such luck!].  Rear doors open into the wind (...), a characteristic of four-door hardtops. But Cadillac engineers say they have developed an adequate safety device to forestall mishaps. Note triangular section that forms upper rear of door. Only chromed strip on side of body (right) is vertical trim, another Cadillac trademark in recent years, which may point the way to more restraint in exterior treatments for the future. Significant item: the Brougham\'s wheel base is 124 inches, five less than the current Cadillac 62 series. Are scaled-down cars coming from other U.S. auto manufacturers?',NULL,NULL,NULL),(36,'36_3',3,NULL,'As everyone knows, the answer to the last question was a definite \"yes\", although the industry had to wait a few more years before new compacts emerged en masse like the Corvair (by Chevrolet), the Comet (by Ford), the Dodge Dart and Plymouth Valiant (by Chrysler) ...and the \"hottest\" compact of them all, the Mustang (by Ford).  More detailed was the report published by Modern Motor in September of the same year. Better than the best, proclaimed the headline. Cadillac said their new Eldorado would make people forget about the Rolls Royce.  As Larry Foley, the columnist, pointed out, that was a tall order.  Illustrating the article was the well-known publicity shot of the rear of the Eldorado Brougham, taken during the Motorama tour in Miami, in which the Brougham was greatly enhanced by a lovely, platinum-blonde, Marilyn Monroe look-alike.  Appropriate excerpts from Larry Foley\'s story are reproduced below:  Two leading United States car-makers have at last got round to considering the needs of their customers - the multi-millionaire.  They believe it is high time he got a car worthy of his bankroll - an American equivalent of the Rolls Royce.  ...the Cadillac has become so common on the U.S. highways that the man at the wheel is no longer a man of distinction.  Quite ordinary people drive Cadillacs. They may be poor, but they want to look rich.  ...By the end of this year [1955] there will be a new class of car owner. Two new cars, intended specifically for the Big Rich, are on the way:  * The Lincoln Continental Mark II, being made by the Ford people.  * The Eldorado Brougham, by Cadillac (General Motors).  Of the two firms, the more vociferous so far have been Cadillac ...[they] have been much more characteristically American in their advance promotion of the Eldorado Brougham.  The Cadillac people announced, simply, that they were going into competition with Rolls-Royce of England. Their new luxury car, they said, \"will make people forget about the Rolls Royce\".  Rolls-Royce of England, who might perhaps have been amused by such presumption, appeared not to hear. Judging by the description of the Eldorado Brougham, R.R. have nothing to fear from the proposed transatlantic competition. With its racy, low-slung lines (overall height only 4ft. 6in.), four headlights, \"quad\" exhaust pipes, \"projectile-shaped\" rear bumpers and massive, flashy chrome-plating, the Eldorado Brougham is hardly likely to appeal to the gentry for whom Rolls-Royce of England have always catered - apparently to their mutual satisfaction, since R.R. have been going strong for 51 years and still need no more resounding form of advertising than their traditional, plain, modest little inserts in such journals as The Times: \"The best car in the world\".  Nobody has ever gainsaid this claim - so you will either admire or smile at Cadillac for their brash prediction that their Eldorado Brougham will depose the Rolls.  The true test of a car\'s value in the eyes of the world is the legends which form around it. On that score Cadillac lags far behind Rolls.  ...It remains to be seen whether Cadillac, with their super-duper car, can match that something [which Rolls Royce was purported to have, in the story]. I doubt it. For one thing, the Eldorado Brougham won\'t even have a decent price-tag.  The best they will be able to do, it seems, will be something around 10\'000 dollars. Why, that won\'t even beat their American rivals, Ford, who are expected to charge around 12\'000 for the Continental Mark II.  With such low [!] prices, both will be far behind the Rolls, which costs 14\'000 dollars - before the real work is put into it, like upholstery to match the linings of milady\'s furs, or hot and cold running water, or jeweled vanity-cases (3000 dollars alone), or gold-plated dashboards with diamond-studded clocks by Cartier, or twin folding-mirrors by Mappin and Webb of London, or concealed bars, or silver-plated bonnets [i.e. hoods], or costly fur lap-robes, or petit-point upholstery (all featured variously in the Rolls Royces of well-known contemporary Britons, Indian rajahs, and Americans).  One comfort for the prospective buyers of these two new models: mass-production will not threaten the exclusiveness of their cars. Production of both will be limited - to 1000 a year for the Eldorado Brougham, and to about eight a day for the Continental [i.e. about 2000 a year].  ...Both are being produced in great secrecy, and neither maker has yet come out with pictures and details.  ...the Eldorado when unveiled is expected to be even less surprising because its prototype was featured, and got wide publicity, as a \"dream car\" at this year\'s Motorama, the annual road-show of General Motors.  The dream car was in fact called the Eldorado Brougham, but the production model will be a modified version of the Motorama exhibit.  One of the modifications will be the [absence of the] slinky blonde in a white evening gown [and the brunette in furs!] who appeared to be part of the Motorama model. Discreet inquiries at Cadillac headquarters indicated that the blonde will not go with the production model [nor will the brunette].           That\'s too bad. I thought the blonde and brunette models were a unique feature on which the Cadillac boys really had poor old Rolls-Royce licked.     Factory merchandising literature on this car includes a small, single card and a small 4-page folder; both pieces show the car painted black instead of the actual color used, which was called Chameleon Green (a shade of turquoise).
